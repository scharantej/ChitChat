## I want to build a chat client with a React front end and Go Lang backend. How can I use Flask to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend?

### HTML Files
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the chat client. It includes the necessary scripts and styles for the React application and establishes a WebSocket connection to the Flask server.
- **`chat.html`**: A component responsible for displaying the chat interface, including the message input field, message list, and user list.

### Routes
- **`/`**: The root route that serves the `index.html` file.
- **`/chat`**: A WebSocket endpoint that handles communication between the client and the backend. It allows the client to send and receive messages and user information.
- **`/users`**: An API endpoint that provides a list of connected users to the client.
- **`/messages`**: An API endpoint that allows the client to retrieve the chat history.

### Sequence of Events
1. The client loads `index.html`, which establishes a WebSocket connection to the Flask server.
2. The client sends messages and user information to the server through the `/chat` WebSocket endpoint.
3. The server broadcasts these messages and user information to all connected clients.
4. The client displays the received messages and user list in the `chat.html` component.
5. The client can retrieve the chat history by making an API call to the `/messages` endpoint.
6. The client can obtain a list of connected users by making an API call to the `/users` endpoint.
